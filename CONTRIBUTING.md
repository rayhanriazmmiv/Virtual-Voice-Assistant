# CONTRIBUTING

Want to join Stephanie's contribting team? Awesome! We're always open to any kind of contributions from your part! This section is designed to give a brief overview of the current features roadmap!

- **Standardize and unify error reporting:** having specific error codes and useful descriptions.
- **Improve UX:** the setup, together with the actual usage of Stephanie should get some focused love in order to make things smoother for the user.
- **Add GUI:** At the moment it is all terminal based, we should definitely get started with implementing a GUI, moving us away from a simple script and getting closer to an actual application.
- **Improve adding modules:** At the moment adding services require acquiring API keys for each of the needed module. We should make this process as painless as possible, guiding the user (probably after GUI).
